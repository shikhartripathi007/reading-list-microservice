# 🎓 Reading List Microservice Learning Journey

Welcome to your hands-on microservices learning adventure! This focused plan will guide you step-by-step through building a complete CRUD microservice from scratch.

## 📋 Complete Learning Plan

### 🎯 What You'll Build
A reading list management system with:
- **Reading List Service**: Complete CRUD API for managing books
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Persistent data storage for your books
- **Docker Containers**: Service and database in separate containers
- **Docker Compose**: Orchestrates both containers together

### 📚 What You'll Learn
- **Flask**: Python web framework and RESTful API design
- **PostgreSQL**: Database operations, connections, and SQL queries
- **Docker**: Containerization concepts and best practices
- **Docker Compose**: Multi-container orchestration
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete patterns
- **API Testing**: Using curl and understanding HTTP methods

### 📖 Your Reading List API
**Book Data Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "The Python Cookbook",
  "author": "David Beazley", 
  "status": "reading",
  "rating": null,
  "notes": "Great for learning advanced Python"
}
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /books` - Get all books
- `GET /books/{id}` - Get specific book
- `POST /books` - Add new book
- `PUT /books/{id}` - Update book
- `DELETE /books/{id}` - Delete book
- `GET /health` - Health check

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Journey

### **Step 1: Basic Flask CRUD API (45 mins)**

#### What You'll Do:
- [ ] Create project structure
- [ ] Build Flask app with all CRUD endpoints
- [ ] Use in-memory storage (list/dictionary)
- [ ] Test endpoints with curl
- [ ] Understand HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

#### What You'll Learn:
- Flask routing and decorators
- JSON request/response handling
- HTTP status codes
- Basic API design principles

**🎯 Goal**: Working Flask API that can manage books in memory

---

### **Step 2: PostgreSQL Integration (60 mins)**

#### Step 2A: Get PostgreSQL Running (15 mins)
- [ ] Run PostgreSQL container with proper configuration
- [ ] Set up environment variables (database name, password, etc.)
- [ ] Test PostgreSQL container is accessible
- [ ] Learn basic Docker networking concepts

#### Step 2B: Connect Flask to PostgreSQL (45 mins)
- [ ] Install Python database libraries (`psycopg2-binary`)
- [ ] Create database connection in Flask
- [ ] Create books database table
- [ ] Replace in-memory storage with database queries
- [ ] Handle database errors gracefully
- [ ] Test data persistence

#### What You'll Learn:
- Docker container management and networking
- Database connections in Python
- SQL queries (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Database schema design
- Error handling and validation
- Environment variables and configuration

**🎯 Goal**: Flask API connected to PostgreSQL with persistent data

---

### **Step 3: Containerization & Docker Compose (60 mins)**

#### What You'll Do:
- [ ] Write Dockerfile for Flask service
- [ ] Create requirements.txt
- [ ] Build and test Docker image
- [ ] Write docker-compose.yml for both services
- [ ] Learn container networking

#### What You'll Learn:
- Docker fundamentals (images vs containers)
- Dockerfile best practices
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Container networking and communication
- Environment variables and configuration

**🎯 Goal**: Complete containerized application with `docker-compose up`

---

### **Step 4: Testing & Validation (30 mins)**

#### What You'll Do:
- [ ] Test all CRUD operations with curl
- [ ] Verify data persistence after container restart
- [ ] Check logs for debugging
- [ ] Understand common troubleshooting steps

#### What You'll Learn:
- API testing techniques
- Docker debugging and logs
- Data persistence verification
- Production readiness concepts

**🎯 Goal**: Fully tested and working microservice system

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:
- [ ] Python 3.8+ installed
- [ ] Docker installed
- [ ] Docker Compose installed
- [ ] A text editor or IDE
- [ ] curl or Postman for API testing

## 📖 Learning Approach

As we go through each step, I'll explain:
- **Why** we're doing something (the reasoning)
- **What** each piece of code does (line-by-line breakdown)
- **How** it fits into the bigger picture (architecture understanding)
- **Common pitfalls** and how to avoid them (real-world insights)

## 🚀 Ready to Start?

This focused approach will teach you:
1. **Core microservice concepts** without overwhelming complexity
2. **Real-world skills** you can apply immediately
3. **Best practices** for Flask, Docker, and PostgreSQL
4. **Debugging techniques** for containerized applications

**Next Step**: Tell me when you're ready to begin with **Step 1: Basic Flask CRUD API**!

I'll guide you through each step, create the code together, and explain every concept as we build. Feel free to ask questions at any point - that's how real learning happens!
